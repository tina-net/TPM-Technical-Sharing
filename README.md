# TPM Technical Sharing

This repository documents my personal learning notes and technical reflections as a TPM (Technical Program Manager) working across system design, AI infrastructure, and cross-functional debugging.

The materials are based on practical experiences from BIOS, EC, and validation coordination, and now extended into AI inference workflows including ONNX, TensorRT, and Triton.

🛠️ Topics covered:
- System-level debug thinking
- Model deployment strategies
- TPM × AI infrastructure mapping
- Cross-region fallback coordination

📘 This is a continuous learning journey — feel free to explore, comment, or share your thoughts!
